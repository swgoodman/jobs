<h1>Jobs</h1>
  Jobs is a Rails based web application designed to help job seekers keep track of leads as they network and interview.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
  I always want to create projects that are used by someone. Whether it is just me or 200,000 active users, programs aren't helpful simply sitting in a github repo. I'm confident Jobs will help me navigate my upcoming job search and believe it can help others too.

<h3>Installation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Fork and Clone the Repo</li>
    <li>Bundle Gems and run migrations</li>
    <li>Boot up a server, I recommend 'Rails s -p 5212'</li>
    <li>Head to "localhost:5212" in your favorite browser</li>
    <li>Network, Learn, Network, Learn, Interview, Interview, Interview, Get Hired!</li>
  </ol>
