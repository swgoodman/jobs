### Description

  Jobs is a Rails based web application designed to help job seekers keep track of leads as they network and interview.
  
  I always want to create projects that are used by someone. Whether it is just me or 200,000 active users, programs aren't helpful simply sitting in a github repo. I'm confident Jobs will help me navigate my upcoming job search and believe it can help others too.
